# PR {#project-title}

## EDS 214 Group Project

## Overall Goals

The goal of this project was to work as a team to perform analytical workflows. In order to do this we used data from the long Term Ecological research network, where chemistry of stream water data was collected in The Luquillo Experimental Forest.

### Additional Goals

### Recreate a graph

The first object of the project was to recreate a graph containing data on Potassium and Nitrogen between 1988 and 1994 for three watersheds within the Loquillo Experimental forest.

### Devising our own question

The second goal of the project was to devise our own question around the data and work as a team to answer this question. We were interested in looking at the relationship between suspended sediment and temperature in the same three watersheds over a longer time frame.

## Running the Code

The data used in this project is on EDI and can be found here: <https://brunj7.github.io/EDS-214-analytical-workflows/group_project.html>.
