Meteorological station on East Peak road in the Elfin Forest of the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico.

## Overall Goals

The goal of this project was to work as a team using an analytical workflow. In order to do this we utilized data from the long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network, specifically we a stream water chemistry data collected within the Luquillo Experimental Forest.

### Additional Goals

### Recreate a graph

The first object of the project was to recreate a graph containing data on Potassium and Nitrogen between 1988 and 1994 for three watersheds within the Loquillo Experimental forest.

### Devising our own question

The second goal of the project was to devise our own question around the data. We were interested in looking at the relationship between suspended sediment and temperature in the same three watersheds over a longer time frame.

## Running the Code

The data used in this project is on EDI and can be found here: <https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923058>
