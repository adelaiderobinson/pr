Meteorological station on East Peak road in the Elfin Forest of the Luquillo Mountains, Puerto Rico.

## Overall Goals

The goal of this project was to work as a team using an analytical workflow. In order to do this we utilized data collected on stream water chemistry within the Luquillo Experimental Forest, this data was collected as part of the the long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network.

### Additional Goals

### Recreate a graph

The first object of the project was to recreate a graph containing data on potassium and nitrogen between 1988 and 1994 for three sites within the Loquillo Experimental Forest.

### Devising our own question

The second goal of the project was to devise our own question around the data. We were interested in looking at the relationship between suspended sediment and temperature at the same three sites over a longer time frame.

## Running the Code

The data used in this project is located on EDI and can be accessed here: <https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=knb-lter-luq.20.4923058>
